NAME
  dotfm - a simple script to manage dotfiles.

SYNOPSIS
  dotfm [-h] [-d] [-v] [-q] COMMAND DOTFILE...

DESCRIPTION
  dotfm is designed to be simple and easy to use. It's really just a
  short-hand for managing symlinks of dotfiles (it's also helpful if
  you don't want to remember or type out the location of a dotfile
  everytime you want to modify it).

ARGUMENTS
  -h --help	Displays help printout
  -d --debug	Display debug logs
  -v --version	Display dotfm version
  -q --quiet	Tell dotfm to shutup (hide info logs)

COMMANDS
  Multiple DOTFILE args can be passed to each command.

  install <DOTFILE>...	
    create a symlink from DOTFILE to it's install location. DOTFILE
    should be the filepath of the dotfile to install.

    If DOTFILE is recognised by dotfm, then a symlink will be created
    at the known install location.

    If DOTFILE is not recognised by dotfm, then you'll be prompted for
    an install location and aliases to reference the dotfile by when
    using dotfm.

  update <ALIAS> <LOCATION>	
    update the location that a previously installed dotfile (with an
	alias matching ALIAS) symlink points to (sets it to point to
	LOCATION).

  remove <DOTFILE>...	
    Remove the file at the install location of the dotfile with an alias
    matching DOTFILE. This is a destructive function, use it carefully.

    Will only remove the file if the file has been installed by dotfm
    (and can be found in DOTFM CSV FILE).

  edit <DOTFILE>...	
    Open DOTFILE in $EDITOR or nano if $EDITOR is not present.

    DOTFILE should be an alias of the dotfile to edit.

  list [<DOTFILE>...]	
    Print a table of the install locations and aliases for all
    dotfiles. If one or more DOTFILE arguments are present, then only
    dotfiles with matching aliases will be listed.

INSTALL
  Go to the source folder of dotfm and run "sudo make install" or "sudo
  make link".

  "sudo make install" - copy dotfm to the install location (recommended
  for most users).

  "sudo make link" - create a symlink of dotfm from its current location
  to the install location (useful if you want to modify it frequently).

  By default the install location of dotfm is /usr/local/bin/dotfm. To
  modify this, just edit the value of DESTBINDIR in the Makefile.

UNINSTALL
  Go to the source folder of dotfm and run "sudo make uninstall".

ENVIRONMENT
  EDITOR	The text editor to edit dotfiles with. If not present,
  		nano will be used.

HINTS
  I would recommend modifying the "KNOWN DOTFILES" array in src/ dotfm.py
  to suite your own needs.

  If you can think of more standard-dotfiles that you think
  should be present in "KNOWN DOTFILES" feel free to get in touch and
  contribute to the list.
