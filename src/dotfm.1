.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBdotfm\fP is designed to be simple and easy to use. It's really just a
short-hand for managing symlinks of dotfiles (it's also helpful if
you don't want to remember or type out the location of a dotfile
everytime you want to modify it).

.PP
Some terminology to avoid confusion:
.RS
.IP \(bu 3
DOTFILE refers to the filepath of the dotfile to be installed
.IP \(bu 3
DESTINATION refers to the location you would usually find a
dotfile at. For example, the location for bashrc is ~/.bashrc
.IP \(bu 3
ALIAS refers to any name used to call a dotfile installed by
\fBdotfm\fP. \fBdotfm\fP recognises the source filepath (DOTFILE) as an alias
.RE
.TP
.B
install, in <DOTFILE> \.\.\.
Create a symlink to DOTFILE from it's DESTINATION and register it.
DOTFILE should be the filepath of the dotfile to install. If this
path matches its DESTINATION, then a symlink won't be created but
the file will still be registered by \fBdotfm\fP.
.RS
.PP
If DOTFILE is recognised by \fBdotfm\fP, then you will be prompted for
an install location and aliases to call the dotfile by. If the
\fB--skip\fP option was passed then the defaults will be used.
.RE
.TP
.B
update, up <ALIAS> <DOTFILE>
update the source DOTFILE path (of the \fBdotfm\fP-registered dotfile
matching ALIAS) that DESTINATION points to.
.TP
.B
remove, rm <ALIAS> \.\.\.
If ALIAS is recognised, then the DESTINATION of the dotfile will be
removed. This is a destructive function, use it carefully.
.RS
.PP
Will only remove the file if the file has been installed by \fBdotfm\fP
(and can be found in DOTFM CSV FILE).
.RE
.TP
.B
edit, ed <ALIAS> \.\.\.
Open DOTFILE in $EDITOR or nano if $EDITOR is not present.
.RS
.PP
DOTFILE should be an alias of the dotfile to edit.
.RE
.TP
.B
list, ls <ALIAS> \.\.\.
Print a table of the install locations and aliases for all
registered dotfiles. If one or more DOTFILE arguments are present,
then only dotfiles with matching aliases will be listed.
.SH INSTALL
Go to the source folder of \fBdotfm\fP and run "sudo make install" or "sudo
make link".
.RS
.IP \(bu 3
"sudo make install" - copy \fBdotfm\fP to the install location (recommended
for most users).
.IP \(bu 3
"sudo make link" - create a symlink of \fBdotfm\fP from its current location
to the install location (useful for development).
.RE
.PP
By default the install location of \fBdotfm\fP is /usr/local/bin/\fBdotfm\fP. To
modify this, just edit the value of DESTBINDIR in the Makefile.
.SH UNINSTALL
Go to the source folder of \fBdotfm\fP and run "sudo make uninstall".
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B
EDITOR
The text editor to edit dotfiles with. If not present,
nano will be used.
.TP
.B
HOME
The home directory of the current user
.SH HINTS
I would recommend modifying the "KNOWN" array in src/ dotfm.py
to suite your own needs if i've missed any dotfiles you frequently use.
