.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBdotfm\fP is designed to be simple and easy to use. It's really just a
short-hand for managing symlinks of dotfiles (it's also helpful if
you don't want to remember or type out the location of a dotfile
everytime you want to modify it).

.SH COMMANDS
Multiple DOTFILE args can be passed to each command.
.TP
.B
install <DOTFILE> \.\.\.
create a symlink from DOTFILE to it's install location. DOTFILE
should be the filepath of the dotfile to install.
.RS
.PP
If DOTFILE is recognised by \fBdotfm\fP, then a symlink will be created
at the known install location.
.PP
If DOTFILE is not recognised by \fBdotfm\fP, then you'll be prompted for
an install location and aliases to reference the dotfile by when
using \fBdotfm\fP.
.RE
.TP
.B
update <DOTFILE> <LOCATION>
update the location that a previously installed dotfile (with an
alias matching ALIAS) symlink points to (sets it to point to
LOCATION).
.TP
.B
remove <DOTFILE>\.\.\.
Remove the file at the install location of the dotfile with an alias
matching DOTFILE. This is a destructive function, use it carefully.
.RS
.PP
Will only remove the file if the file has been installed by \fBdotfm\fP
(and can be found in DOTFM CSV FILE).
.RE
.TP
.B

.RS
.PP

.RE
.TP
.B
list [<DOTFILE> \.\.\.]
Print a table of the install locations and aliases for all
dotfiles. If one or more DOTFILE arguments are present, then only
dotfiles with matching aliases will be listed.
.SH INSTALL

make link".
.PP
"sudo make install" - copy \fBdotfm\fP to the install location (recommended
for most users).
.PP
"sudo make link" - create a symlink of \fBdotfm\fP from its current location
to the install location (useful if you want to modify it frequently).
.PP
By default the install location of \fBdotfm\fP is /usr/local/bin/\fBdotfm\fP. To
modify this, just edit the value of DESTBINDIR in the Makefile.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B
EDITOR
The text editor to edit dotfiles with. If not present,
nano will be used.
.SH HINTS
I would recommend modifying the "KNOWN" array in src/ dotfm.py
to suite your own needs if i've missed any dotfiles you frequently use.
